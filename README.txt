Qingyao Ai, Vahid Azizi, Xu Chen, Yongfeng Zhang.
Learning Heterogeneous Knowledge Base Embeddings for Explainable Recommendation
Algorithms. 2018, 11(9). Special Issue Collaborative Filtering and Recommender Systems.

which conducts knowledge graph reasoning to provide explainable recommendations.

The code consisits of two basic modules, a recommendation module (main.py and MultiViewEmbedding.py), and an explanation module (explain_results.py).
